    This function also computes the correlations per interrogation window, so that poorly correlated values can be
    filtered out. Furthermore, the resolution is used to convert pixel per second velocity estimates, into meter per
    second velocity estimates. The centre of search area columns and rows are also returned so that a georeferenced
    grid can be written from the results.

    window_size=60, overlap=30, search_area_size=60, dt=1./25

    Extended area search can be used to increased dynamic range. The search region
    in the second frame is larger than the interrogation window size in the
    first frame. For Cython implementation see
    openpiv.process.extended_search_area_piv

    This is a pure python implementation of the standard PIV cross-correlation
    algorithm. It is a zero order displacement predictor, and no iterative
    process is performed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frame_a : 2d np.ndarray
        an two dimensions array of integers containing grey levels of
        the first frame.

    frame_b : 2d np.ndarray
        an two dimensions array of integers containing grey levels of
        the second frame.

    window_size : int
        the size of the (square) interrogation window, [default: 32 pix].

    overlap : int
        the number of pixels by which two adjacent windows overlap
        [default: 16 pix].

    dt : float
        the time delay separating the two frames [default: 1.0].

    correlation_method : string
        one of the two methods implemented: 'circular' or 'linear',
        default: 'circular', it's faster, without zero-padding
        'linear' requires also normalized_correlation = True (see below)

    subpixel_method : string
         one of the following methods to estimate subpixel location of the
         peak:
         'centroid' [replaces default if correlation map is negative],
         'gaussian' [default if correlation map is positive],
         'parabolic'.

    sig2noise_method : string
        defines the method of signal-to-noise-ratio measure,
        ('peak2peak' or 'peak2mean'. If None, no measure is performed.)

    width : int
        the half size of the region around the first
        correlation peak to ignore for finding the second
        peak. [default: 2]. Only used if ``sig2noise_method==peak2peak``.

    search_area_size : int
       the size of the interrogation window in the second frame,
       default is the same interrogation window size and it is a
       fallback to the simplest FFT based PIV

    normalized_correlation: bool
        if True, then the image intensity will be modified by removing
        the mean, dividing by the standard deviation and
        the correlation map will be normalized. It's slower but could be
        more robust

    use_vectorized : bool
        If set, vectorization is used to speed up analysis.

    Returns
    -------
    u : 2d np.ndarray
        a two dimensional array containing the u velocity component,
        in pixels/seconds.

    v : 2d np.ndarray
        a two dimensional array containing the v velocity component,
        in pixels/seconds.

    sig2noise : 2d np.ndarray, ( optional: only if sig2noise_method != None )
        a two dimensional array the signal to noise ratio for each
        window pair.


    The implementation of the one-step direct correlation with different
    size of the interrogation window and the search area. The increased
    size of the search areas cope with the problem of loss of pairs due
    to in-plane motion, allowing for a smaller interrogation window size,
    without increasing the number of outlier vectors.
