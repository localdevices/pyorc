=============
API reference
=============

**pyorc**'s consists of several subclasses of the ``xarray.Dataset`` and ``xarray.DataArray`` data models.
In a nutshell, xarray_'s data models are meant to store and analyze scientific datasets with multiple
dimensions. A ``xarray.DataArray`` contains one variable with possibly several dimensions and coordinates
within those dimensions. A ``xarray.Dataset`` may contain multiple ``xarray.DataArray`` objects, with shared 
coordinates. In **pyorc** typically the coordinates are ``time`` for time epochs measured in seconds since
the beginning of a video, ``x`` for horizontal grid spacing (in meters), ``y`` for vertical grid spacing 
(in meters). Operations you can apply on both data models are very comparable with operations you may
already use in pandas_, such as resampling, reindexing, aggregations, and so on.


.. note::
    We highly recommend to use the excellent xarray_ manual side-by-side with ``pyorc`` to understand
    how to effectively work with the xarray_ ecosystem.

In the remaining sections, we describe the API classes, and the functions they are based on.
