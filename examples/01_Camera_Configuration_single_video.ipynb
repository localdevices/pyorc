    "## Setup a camera configuration for processing a single video\n",
    "To process a video, a camera configuration is needed. The camera configuration makes the processing aware how to project the movie's frames to an orthorectified plane with real-world distances, and a user defined area of interest and processing resolution. It also tells the processing what the water level during the survey video is, so that the depth can be estimated, once bathymetry cross-sections are added. The process for a fixed video setup that takes videos with changing water level conditions is slightly more advanced. Therefore we here start with the assumption that you walk to a stream with a smart phone and a GPS (RTK) device or a spirit level instrument, record control points and record a short video for just one single observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will extract one frame from the survey video to grab the control points. For this example, field observations were collected at the Ngwerere River, in Lusaka. We will first setup an empty camera configuration, and then gradually fill this with the required information. Along the way we plot what we have in a geospatial plot. The information we add is:\n",
    "* Ground-control points (row and columns locations in the frame as well as real world coordinates)\n",
    "* Row and column coordinates that define the area of interest.\n",
    "* The water level during the video and survey (set at zero, because this survey was only done for one single video, this is only relevant if multiple videos with different water levels are processed)\n",
    "* The position of the camera lens. This is relevant in case multiple videos with different water levels are processed. We here add this, but it is not actually used. \n"

If you want to interactively view coordinates you can add `%matplotlib notebook` to the top of the cell. You can then hover over the image with your mouse and see the coordinates in the bottom-right. velocimetry is normally done on one image channel (greyscale), but we first explicitly use `method=\"rgb\"` to extract one frame in rgb colorspace for finding the points."
