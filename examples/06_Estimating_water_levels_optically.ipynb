    "If you do not have the means to measure a water level from incoming new videos of a scene, but you do have a fully configured camera configuration and a *in situ* measured cross section, you may assess the water level by automatic optical inference of the water level along the cross section. In this notebook we demonstrate how you can use these methods.\n",

    "The starting point for measuring a water level in an incoming video is an existing camera configuration, which provides the information on the camera's perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we require a cross section. The way the water level measurement approach works is roughly as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the algorithm hypothesizes a randomly chosen possible location in the cross section as being the location where the cross section is exactly on the edge of the water surface.\n",
    "- At that location, the algorithm draws a line, perpendicular to the cross-section as a hypothesis of being the water line.\n",
    "- The algorithm then creates horizontally oriented rectangles, left and right of the hypothesized water line, projects these to the image, and samples intensities from a derived image of the incoming video.\n",
    "- The intensity distributions of both rectangles are compared. If the distributions are very different it is more likely that the drawn line indeed represented the water line, if they are quite similar it is less likely.\n",
    "- The algorithm uses a search method to repeatedly do this analysis and find the location where the intensity distribution function are the most dissimilar. The vertical level belonging to this cross-section location is retrieved and returned to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show what the cross section object contains, and show how it can be used to estimate the water level.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we load in a cross section, a video, and a camera configuration. Note:\n",
    "- we use here the same video as before, but you can use any video with any water level as long as it belongs to the same camera configuration and the cross section reaches far enough into the banks to be able to detect it crossing the water surface.\n",
    "- we only use a single frame from the video as we don't need to interpret movements."
