By default, quantiles [0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95] are derived, but this can also be modified with the `quantile` parameter. During the sampling, the bathymetry points are resampled to more or less match the resolution of the velocimetry results, in order to get a dense enough sampling. You can also impose a resampling distance using the `distance` parameter. If you would set this to 0.1, then a velocity will be sampled each 0.1 meters. Because our velocimetry grid has a 0.13 m resolution, the distance will by default be 0.13. The variables `v_eff_nofill` and `v_dir` are added, which is the effective velocity scalar, and its angle, perpendicular to the cross-section direction. `v_eff_nofill` at this stage may contain gaps because of unknown velocities in moments and locations where the mask methods did not provide satisfactory samples.\n",
