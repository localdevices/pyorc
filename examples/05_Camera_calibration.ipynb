    "## Camera calibration\n",
    "**pyorc** is equipped with a very straightforward manner to calibrate your camera lens. The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take a video with a chessboard pattern ensuring you maximize difference in location in the FOV where the chessboard is shown, and the different rotation angles under which the chessboard is shown. Ensure that the video is taken with the *exact same settings* as you expect to use in the field.\n",
    "* Start with a fresh camera configuration, ensuring height and width follow the settings of your intended video resolution\n",
    "* Feed in the calibration video. This will extract a set amount of frames with recognised chessboard patterns widely sampled over the entire video, calibrate the intrinsic matrix and distortion coefficients, and overwrite these in the camera configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will demonstrate this entire process. It should be noted that if your lens only has very little distortion, this process is likely not needed and may in fact even deteriorate your results."

    "So what happened? The algorithm siffs through all frames in such a way that all parts of the video are very well covered (i.e. not in the order in which the frames are stored). It start with the first and last frame. Then samples the frame in the middle. Then in between the first and middle, and middle and last, and so forth. In this way we ensure that all poses shown are well sampled and that we do not end up with many samples that show almost the same pose, causing overfitting of the parameters on just one pose (which may in fact give very very bad results, rendering camera calibration a bad thing rather than a good thing. The algorithm stops searching for corner points once `max_frames` is reached, which defaults to 30. The progress bar therefore does not reach 100%, because that would mean all frames in the video are read. The error is a measure for the average pixel error made when projecting the found corner points back to the image using the calibrated parameters. Let's check what the intrinsic matrix and distortion coefficients look like."
