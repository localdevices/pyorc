    "You have a result stored in a NetCDF file after running notebook 02. Now you want to see if the results seem to make sense, and further analyze these. Especially post-processing of your results with masking invalid velocities is an essential step in most velocimetry analyses, given that sometimes hardly any tracers are visible, and only spuriously correlated results were found. With some intelligence these suspicious velocities can be removed, and `pyorc` has many methods available to do that. Most of these can be applied without any parameter changes for a good result. The order in which mask methods are applied can matter, which we will describe later in this notebook.\n",

    "As you can see, we have lots of coordinate variables at our disposal, these can be used in turn to plot our data in a local projection, with our bounding box top-left corner at the top-left. The `x` and `y` axes hold the local coordinates. We can also use the UTM35S coordinates, stored in `xs` and `ys`, the longitude and latitude coordinates stored in `lon` and `lat`, or....(very cool) the original row and column coordinate of the camera's objective. This allows us to plot the results as an augmented reality view.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data variables, we see `v_x` and `v_y` for the x-directional and y-directional velocity, measured along the `x` and `y` axis of the local coordinate system. Furthermore we see the `s2n` variable containing the signal to noise ratio computed by the underlying used library OpenPIV. This ratio is computed as the ratio between the highest correlation and the second highest correlation found in the surroundings of each window. If this ratio is very low it means that it is difficult to assess which correlation value is the best. We also store the highest correlation found in the variable `corr`. As this is done for each frame to frame pair, the dataset contains 125 time steps, since we extract 126 frames.\n",

    "Because we used a 0.01 resolution and a 25 pixel interrogation window, and `pyorc` typically uses an overlap between windows of 50%, the `y` and `x` coordinates have a spacing of `25 * 0.01 * 0.5 = 0.125 cm` (rounded to 0.13).\n",

    "Already this looks very promising. But we haven't yet analyzed any of the velocities for spurious values. Even over land we have estimates of velocities, while there is no moving water there. We have a set of temporal masking methods which analyze for spurious values by comparing over time steps, and spatial masking methods, which compare neighbouring grid cell values to flag spurious values. These are defined under a subclass in ``ds.velocimetry.mask``. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mask methods all return a xr.DataArray with the same size as the DataArray variables in the dataset and can be applied in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- first defining several masks, without applying these on the dataset, and then collectively apply them. This is the default behaviour. Masks can be collectively applied with ``ds.velocimetry.mask([mask1, mask2, mask3, ...])``.\n",
    "- apply the mask immediately on the dataset (use ``inplace=True`` on each mask method).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last case, you should be aware that applying another mask method after having applied other mask methods makes the results conditional on masks already applied. Therefore in this case the order in which you apply masks will change the results. For instance, if you first mask out velocities that are outside a minimum / maximum velocity range using ``ds.velocimetry.mask.minmax``, and only after that mask out based on variance in time (points with a high variance can be masked), the computed variance over time for each location will likely already be lower, because you may have excluded outlier velocities. The method ``ds.velocimetrry.mask.count`` simply counts how many values are found per grid cell, relative to the total amount of time steps available. This method typically requires that you first apply a set of other mask methods, before being applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we decided to apply masks in a certain order, and conditional on each other. We start with masks that can typically be applied on individual values, such as the ``minmax`` and ``corr``. And then gradually move to masks that require analysis of all values in time, such as the ``variance`` method and (see above) the ``count`` method. This is typically the good practice.\n"

    "Interesting! We see that the velocities become a lot higher on average. Most likely because many spurious velocities are removed. We also see that the velocities seem to be more left-to-right oriented. In part this may be because we applied the `.mask.angle` method. This mask removes velocities that are in a direction, far off from the expected flow direction. The default direction of this mask is always left to right. Therefore take good care of this mask, if you decide to e.g. apply `pyorc` in a bottom to top direction.\n",

The spatial mask we demonstrate here compares the value under consideration against a window mean around that location. If the window mean (after reducing the ``time`` dimension with a mean) is very different, the value at that location will be excluded.\n"
