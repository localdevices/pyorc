    "You have a result stored in a NetCDF file after running notebook 02. Now you want to see if the results seem to make sense, and further analyze these. Especially post-processing of your results with filter is an essential step in most velocimetry analyses, given that sometimes hardly any tracers are visible, and only spuriously correlated results were found. With some intelligence these suspicious velocities can be removed, and `pyorc` has many methods available to do that. Most of these can be applied without any parameter changes for a good results. \n",

    "As you can see, we have lots of coordinate variables at our disposal, these can be used in turn to plot our data in a local projection, with our bounding box top-left corner at the top-left. The `x` and `y` axes hold the local coordinates. We can also use the UTM35S coordinates, stored in `xs` and `ys`, the longitude and latitude coordinates stored in `lon` and `lat`, or....(very cool) the original row and column coordinate of the camera's objective. This allows us to plot the results as an augmented reality view.\n",

Furthermore we see the `s2n` variable containing the signal to noise ratio computed by the underlying used library OpenPIV. This ratio is computed as the ratio between the highest correlation and the second highest correlation found in the surroundings of each window. We also store the highest correlation found in the variable `corr`. As this is done for each frame to frame pair, the dataset contain 124 time steps, since we extract 125 frames.\n",

    "Interesting! We see that the velocities become a lot higher on average. Most likely because many spurious velocities are removed. We also see that the velocities seem to be more left-to-right oriented. In part this may be because we applied the `.filter_temporal_angle` method under the hood. This filter removes velocities that are in a direction, far off from the expected direction. The default direction of this filter is always left to right. Therefore take good care of this filter, if you decide to apply `pyorc` in a bottom to top direction.\n",
